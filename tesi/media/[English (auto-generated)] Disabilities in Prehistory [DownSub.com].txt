hello guys and welcome back to another

episode of trade explainer and today we

have another installment of anthropology

profile and today we have a rather

fascinating and interesting topic in my

opinion because we're gonna talk about

disabilities and physical abnormalities

wait for it in prehistory disabilities

or handicap seem to have existed as long

as life itself has evolved and by far

long predates humanity these physical

conditions appear in animal populations

almost constantly and can be a result of

either genetic traits that result in

abnormal growth from birth or a disease

or injury developed over the course of

one's life that doesn't fully heal or

recover and typically when these

physical handicaps arose and organism

populations like a lame foot or

paralysis or even something as minor as

poor vision individual organisms with

disabilities would be killed off by the

process of natural selection

who'da predators or inability to find

food or mates it was an unfortunate but

effective system and it was just the way

of the world a rabbit that is deaf or

ghazal with a bad foot is much less

likely to escape a fox or lion than one

with healthy ears and feet but us humans

have a knack for messing things up and

somewhere along the line humanity

started to care for and aid these

individuals we developed something

called compassion for example anyone

around today can be born paralyzed from

the waist down or completely blind

or mentally disabled and survive to

adulthood live a long and happy life no

problem due to the compassion and care

society and their family members give

them when in the wild and before the

development of modern medicine this

would have been the case humans have to

a certain extent slowed natural

selection

technically depending on your definition

a lot of us have physical disabilities

that would be selected out of the

population if we lived in the

hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our

Paleolithic ancestors I have very poor

eyesight a trait that was passed down

from both my parents and I required the

assistance of glasses and contacts in

order to do almost anything so odds are

I'd be Dinah felis food if I lived in

prehistoric times or at the very least

considered handicapped before they have

been of glasses

earlier today I took a moment to look

around the food court I was in to see

how many people possessed this

disability in my field of view

alone about like 50% of people had

glasses on bygone are the days in which

we would leave somebody to get eaten or

star for a disability we tend to think

that this is a relatively recent

development in our culture as a people

and to some extent it is human societies

definitely haven't always tolerated or

cared for disabled or handicapped

individuals attitudes towards

handicapped individuals have changed

most drastically in the past several

centuries heck just in the past century

we had eugenics and freak shows that

plan to eliminate or denigrate such

individuals respectively mental

disabilities and dwarfism and mediaeval

Europe were considered the product of

demonic possession and sin and we're

often treated as such with their only

opportunities to survive in society

being as court jesters and fools other

societies most famously the ancients

pardons if histories are to be believed

killed infants that possessed the

slightest bit of imperfections imposing

a biological artificial selection of

sorts on themselves even someone as

bright as Aristotle is said to have been

an advocate for eugenics and the killing

of disabled children when saying let

there be a law that no deformed child

shall live when you learn how cruel

societies once were one shudders to

wonder what life was for disabled

individuals further back into prehistory

when life was even a rougher and tougher

and more brutal surely disabled

individuals would have had no place in

Paleolithic hunter-gatherer societies we

often get this image that prehistoric

humans in ancient humans or cavemen were

much like animals in this respect cruel

cold and savage they would let natural

selection take its course with such

individuals letting them starve or die

as a result of their inability to

survive in their harsh environment but

this couldn't be further from the truth

there is actually an enormous amount of

evidence to illustrate that peoples and

societies throughout history regardless

of time period or location showed

compassion to disabled individuals and

not only caring for them but at times

treating them and accepting them into

society as normal and valued members and

at times even honoring them as heroes in

spite of their handicaps and it really

breaks down the idea that these were

cavemen or savages they were people

people who cared and loved for one

another deeply and in this episode I'll

be giving the amazing examples of these

trends and the individual remains and

stories that prove of them but before we

talk about them let's talk about the

biology of

compassion and what is it exactly

compassion and altruism are a

fascinating evolutionary phenomena we

are incredibly social animals and it is

perhaps our most important trait next to

intelligence as I will show throughout

history we have a very strong instinct

for kinship and compassion something in

our genes tells us to help fellow

members of our species even if it isn't

exactly advantageous for ourselves and

there are many possible scientific

explanations for why this might have

evolved in the first place

I find it likely that this might have

developed or stemmed from a you scratch

my back I scratch yours kind of thing

where cooperation helped our species in

our ancestors survive in times of crisis

we typically don't like to see other

members of our species suffer or die and

it likely relates to the days in which

the loss of a group member in a tribe

meant the likely death of an entire

tribe an alternative explanation might

have been a more complicated form of

natural selection we're saving or

helping those who carry the same genes

as you like a brother or sister ensured

a higher likelihood of your own gene

survival although you yourself are not

the one directly passing them down

compassion or altruism doesn't seem to

be limited to humans chimpanzees both in

the wild and in captivity have been

documented demonstrating selflessness in

care one individual rescued a member of

their family from drowning in a wild

adult male chimpanzee adopted an

unrelated orphaned chimp as his own food

and meat are typically shared amongst

the entire tribe regardless of who

hunted and who didn't in chimp society's

tools such as a hammer or anvil used for

cracking nuts have been documented to be

shared amongst group members the list

goes on and on and definitely isn't

limited to just chimpanzees whether this

is true compassion or not it nonetheless

demonstrates that primates closely

related to us are capable of showing

selflessness and it might say something

about the emotions and attitudes of

primitive humans which is exactly what

we are talk about now Neanderthals there

are pop culture depictions of other

humans that coexisted with our ancestors

Neanderthals or Homo erectus haven't

been too flattering to say the least it

might be because of their appearance

with the sloping forehead and heavy brow

but other members of Homo are often

believed to have been much more ape-like

in behavior than us Homo sapiens

they are often depicted as ignorant and

stupid squat in sluggish brutes ape men

who live

brutal lives and would leave their dead

and dying to the wolf's and scavengers

HD Wells described them as the grizzly

folk in one of his short stories in

which he portrayed Neanderthals in much

the same manner in which he described

his fictional human descendants of the

far future the Morlocks as savage and

barbaric creatures that only vaguely

resembled humanity only in shape and

advocated for their extinction yes a

Neanderthals have become the

quintessential caveman image and

according to pop culture of prehistoric

Homo sapiens were cruel Neanderthals

were even cooler than that

however this image of Neanderthals even

more ancient humans is likely entirely

false and they were in fact more like us

emotionally and mentally than we

typically like to think there is a cave

at the top of a mountain in Iraq that

speaks volumes to Neanderthal family

bonds and concepts of kinship and

compassion deep within the depths of the

shanidar cave the remains of several 65

thousand to 35 thousand year old

Neanderthals were discovered

now Neanderthal bones are relatively

common throughout Europe in the Middle

East but the curious thing about the

ones in this cave in particular is that

the Neanderthal individuals that resided

in it apparently attained absurdly old

ages one individual was at the time of

their death between the ages of 35 and

40 and two individuals were somewhere

between the ages of 40 and 50 this

needless to say was an amazing feat for

the time period in environmental

conditions Neanderthals and even Homo

sapiens scarcely reached such ages at

the time with the equivalent in modern

human years today probably being around

80 years old the age of these

individuals alone says something about

the culture and family unit they belong

to but it gets more interesting when one

examines one of these elderly

Neanderthals closer one sculptor named

Shanna Darwin or Nandi for short by

excavators upon closer inspection wasn't

only very old but possessed many

physical deformities visible on his body

his skull specifically Illustrated that

he had been violently struck or hit on

the left side of his face at some time

in its life this blow was so hard that

it fractured his left orbit which would

have left him partially if not fully

blind in one of his eyes furthermore

later analysis showed that he suffered

from serious hearing loss in both of his

ears due to blockage partially in his

left and fully in his right which meant

he must have been close to death a

serious handicap for a hunter-gatherer

lifestyle but that's not all Nandi also

appears to have suffered from a withered

arm something he appears to

might have possessed since birth which

essentially meant that he lost the use

of his lower arm in hand this arm

appears to have been later amputated at

the elbow later in his life

lastly possibly related to all the after

mentioned injuries and disabilities

Nandi also possessed deformities in his

lower legs and foot that resulted to him

possessing a serious and painful limp in

order to walk poor a Nandi man that

stinks

with all those injuries and deformities

Nandi simple day-to-day life would have

been especially painful and excruciating

but and this is the most interesting

thing of all is that all these

afflictions were acquired long before

his death and show signs of extensive

healing living with such ailments mint

that Nandi obviously couldn't have cared

for himself and even simple tasks like

walking or even communicating would have

been near impossible and very painful he

would have been a complete burden on his

family but despite all his flaws all his

needs this one-armed deafblind man's

family cared for him they must have fed

him cleaned up after him loved him

nonetheless and kept him alive for a

very long time despite the fact that he

couldn't reciprocate or contribute to

their survival he was somebody's father

or grandfather or uncle and they loved

him for it Nandi provides just by his

existence than the and earth all's cared

for they're sick and elderly just as we

do today but Nandi might just be the tip

of the iceberg a cranium discovered in

Spain and dated older than five hundred

thousand years old might suggest the

compassion existed in humans for a very

very long time much older than even

Nandi SH 14 is a skull discovered in

Spain that belonged to a young child

that survived to the age of at least

five years old the skull although small

and seemingly insignificant possesses

the earliest known case of human brain

deformity in the fossil record the age

of the remains suggests they belonged to

a member of Homo erectus perhaps among

the ancestors of the Neanderthals like

Nandi again the age of the skull

suggests something about the family of

the child it was born into the physical

deformity this child possessed would

have been easily and clearly visible

even at a young age in early and

development however this child was not

tossed aside or ejected at birth but was

kept and survived for years why it seems

like ignoring those sloping foreheads

and heavy brows our distant ancestors

and relatives or people just like us and

felt and loved much like we do

and it is neanderthals and maybe even

Homo erectus not us Homo sapiens that

show the earliest evidence of compassion

and care for the disabled us Homo

sapiens do however have a lot of

evidence of care for the physically

disabled throughout prehistory perhaps

the earliest of this is evidence of

dwarfism in a 10,000 year old boy from

Paleolithic southern Italy the skeleton

of Roma totu was discovered in a cave

alongside several other humans judging

from his skeleton Ramin to--to was a

young man that survived to about 17 to

20 years of age

but what was quickly apparent was that

he had been born with a severe case of

tourism he would have possessed normal

intelligence and no serious medical

conditions however his arms and body

would have been very short and he would

have possessed limited mobility of his

elbows and knees in hunter-gatherer

lifestyle Remi to--to would have

possessed a serious handicap when

hunting or just keeping up with a group

especially when looking at rugged

terrain in which he lived

however again his age of 17 suggests

that he was at the very least tolerated

in cared for by his community and maybe

even something more the cave in which r2

was found pierced have been an important

social and ritual sinner and from the

limited number of burials in the cave it

can be inferred that only certain

members of society that achieved a

certain status could be buried there

ramita too might not have only been

tolerated by society but he had been

accepted or even honored by it despite

his severe handicaps and limited

abilities warps have existed throughout

history and as an intro to this video

shows it appears attitudes to them have

varied from culture to culture there is

a skeleton discovered the remains of a

Byzantine city cemetery in Israel from

the 5th to 8th century that might have

been dude is medieval time period a

living breathing tyrion lanister this

male dwarf lived to between 35 to 50

years old but most interesting is his

burial in the Christian Cemetery his

burial position and grave were virtually

identical to every other person buried

in that cemetery the unremarkable and

ordinary nature of his burial says

something as it seems to suggest that

this individual in the eyes of the

population of the Byzantine city was an

ordinary member of society and should be

treated as an equal despite his physical

appearance paralysis another interesting

case of prehistoric humans caring for

disabled individuals is the abundance of

semi-paralyzed

- paralyzed in

vigils in the archaeological record the

remains of a young boy were found in

Florida and were 7500 years old the boy

however had been born with a severe

spinal malformation which would have

made him among other things paralyzed

from the waist down from birth

nonetheless he survived another 15 years

another boy from Vietnam four thousand

years ago had been born with clay

pow'ful syndrome and as a result his

movements were limited to perhaps only

his arms but he lived to ten years old

both these boys belonged to

hunter-gathering two semi

hunter-gathering societies but again

were cared for nonetheless but perhaps

my favorite of prehistoric paralyzed

individuals has to be that of a 4000

year old woman from the Arabian

Peninsula

the woman had contracted a severe

neuromuscular disease likely polio in

her early life which caused her limbs to

be exceedingly thin and walking a

movement very difficult according to

anthropologist Debra L Martin she would

have required around-the-clock care and

that seems to have been exactly what she

got as she lived to the age of 18

ironically one of the few health

problems her body possessed was not a

result of her disease this woman's teeth

were full of cavities counties that

likely resulted from her family group

feeding her too many dates

apparently spoiling her with sweets to

make her happy the enormous amount of

sticky sweet she was fed eventually

rotted her teeth out which is very

unusual for someone so young and of that

time period but perhaps my all-time

favorite example of handicapped

individuals throughout history has to be

a single skeleton buried in a Native

American burial mound in northwestern

Georgia at the king site in David J

Haley's book King the social archaeology

of a late Mississippi in town in

northwestern Georgia Lyndon to me by one

of my professors thank you so much

Hallie examined the large amount of

named American human remains

ceremonially buried at the site

halli references the skeleton of a

single individual named burial

two-to-three this individual had been

buried with all the traits of male

warriors of high military honors in

warfare in Mississippi in society points

massive by facial blades hematite in

baku lemma all symbols and trophies

achieved through and to display great

acts of military valor and it was

assumed that this was a great male

warrior in life so it was a complete

shock when the

evidence illustrate that the skeleton

and all those trophies and symbols of

military status belong to a 25 year old

woman who upon closer examination had a

severe hip deformity likely received

through an accident in childbirth two to

three stands alone as an exception in

the entire site the culture our king

especially in the burials put great

emphasis on the gender distinctions

between male and female categories women

at the king's site are typically lacking

in burial objects and are never buried

with the overwhelmingly traditional male

artifacts she had been buried with

everything about her burial was common

of a male but he was a she and she seems

to stand against the distinct and strict

gender categories presented at the rest

of the site and not only was she buried

with the military honors

but extremely high ones the average age

of males buried with large Barr facial

blades is 40 years old two to three was

25 when she died and seems to have

achieved such a high status as a warrior

in an extremely short amount of time the

physical disability that would have made

walking and running a little difficult

meaning she not only overcame several

difficulties in her lifetime but it rose

to the top as a bona fide hero despite

her age physical deformity and gender

this woman very likely lived a truly

fascinating life it's probably an

amazing story about a person who was

dealt a difficult situation but by far

rose above their situation through

willpower and dedication she might have

been a female Native American version of

the fabled disabled Viking warrior Ivar

the boneless she also seems to have

vindicated Cherokee stories of warrior

women fierce female warriors who fought

in battles and achieved privileges

typically reserved for men who by some

accounts became warrior women to avenge

their slain husbands by going on a

revenge mission killing their husbands

killers you got a widowed warrior woman

with a hip deformity only bones could

talk the unknown in the unspoken all

these individuals seem to completely

dissolve the idea that early humans were

savage or cruel when it comes to

handicaps and disabilities it seems many

of them if you were dwarfed or paralyzed

or simply received major injuries were

treated normally by their societies and

at times even elevated above that it

seems compassion has always been there

and the incidents in which it occurred

were overshadowed by times it didn't the

simple fact we have found so many people

like this in the fossil and archeologic

record says something about the

prevalence of compassion and care

towards disabled individuals the reigns

of people in general preserving survivor

enough already so therefore there must

have been an enormous number of stories

like these ones common throughout

prehistoric societies in history so next

time you see depictions of cavemen being

cruel and unfeeling creatures just think

of the countless cases which our

ancestors Illustrated that they had a

heart and with that thanks for watching

it's been really neat researching and

learning about how common disabilities

were in the ancient world and seeing how

all our ancestors were people people who

cared for one another deeply it's a

hopeful thing to think about next time

you lose hope and humanity's goodness if

Neanderthals can love and care for one

another why shouldn't we I know I know

that's a really cheesy line anyways

thank you so much for watching I hope

you enjoyed and learned something from

this episode of anthropology profile I

am deeply sorry for the long wait on

this one you know hope to see you next

time
