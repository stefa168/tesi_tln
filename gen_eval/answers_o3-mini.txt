Yes, the automaton is directed.
Yes, the automaton is directed.
The automaton processes the binary symbols 0 and 1 as its inputs. It does not produce outputs separately; the symbols label the transitions between states.
The automaton accepts binary strings over {0, 1} that are exactly repeated iterations of the block "11100" (including the empty string). In other words, its language is (11100)*.
q0 is both an initial and an accepting state, shown with a double circle. It receives a transition labeled 0 from q4 and sends out a transition labeled 1 to q1.
State q0 is both an initial and an accepting state, depicted with a double circle. It receives an incoming transition on the symbol 0 from state q4 and has an outgoing transition on the symbol 1 to state q1.
The only final state is q0.
The only final state is q0.
No, there is no directed arc from q1 to q0.
Yes, q0 is directly connected to q1 by a transition labeled "1".
No, there are no transitions where the starting state is the same as the ending state.
No, there is no transition from a state back to itself.
For q1, the only incoming transition is from q0 with input 1, and the only outgoing transition goes to q2 with input 1.
State q2 has an incoming link from q1 labeled 1 and an outgoing link to q3 labeled 1.
State q2 has an entry transition coming from q1 labeled "1" and an exit transition going to q3 also labeled "1."
