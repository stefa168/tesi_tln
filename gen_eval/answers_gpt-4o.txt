Yes, the automaton is directed.
Yes, the automaton is directed.
The automaton uses two input symbols: "0" and "1." There are no separate output symbols in this finite state automaton; outputs correspond to the transitions themselves based on the input symbols.
The finite state automaton recognizes strings consisting of one or more occurrences of the symbol "1" followed by the symbol "0". This pattern repeats, forming a cycle that the automaton can follow continuously.
State q0 is the starting and final state, indicated by its double-circle shape. It has one outgoing transition to state q1 with the input '1' and one incoming transition from state q4 with the input '0'.
State q0 is both the start and final state in this finite state automaton. It is represented by a double circle. The transitions involving q0 are as follows: there is an incoming transition from state q4 with the input '0', and an outgoing transition to state q1 with the input '1'.
The state that is considered final is "q0".
The final state in the automaton is q0.
No, a directed arc does not exist from q1 to q0.
Yes, q0 is directly connected to q1 by a transition labeled "1".
No, there are no transitions in this finite state automaton where the start and end state are identical.
No, there is no looping transition from a state back to the same state in this finite state automaton.
For state q1, the incoming transition is from state q0 with input '1'. The outgoing transition is to state q2 with input '1'.
State q2 in the automaton has one incoming link from state q1 with a transition labeled "1" and one outgoing link to state q3 with a transition labeled "1".
For state q2, the entry transition comes from state q1 with the input symbol '1', and the exit transition goes to state q3 with the input symbol '1'.
