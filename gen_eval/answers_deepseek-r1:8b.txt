Yes, the automaton is directed because each node has at most one outgoing transition for any given input symbol.
Yes, the automaton is directed, as indicated by the "directed": true property in the data.
The automaton processes two symbols: **0** and **1**, as these are the only symbols present in transitions_in and transitions_out.  Answer: The automaton accepts inputs consisting of symbols **0** and **1**.
The automaton recognizes all strings composed of the symbols '0' and '1'.  **Answer:** The automaton recognizes all strings over the alphabet {0, 1}.
State `q0` is both a start and a final state. It transitions to `q1` via label "1".
State `q0` is both a start and final state. It transitions to `q1` on input '1' and receives from `q4` on input '0'.
The states `q0` and `q4` are considered final.  **Answer:** The final states are `q0` and `q4`.
The final state in the automaton is **q0**.  Answer: q0
No directed arc exists from q1 to q0.
Yes, q0 is directly connected to q1 via a transition with label "1".
No, there are no transitions in this FSA where the start and end states are identical. All transitions move from one state to another without any self-loops.
No, there are no looping transitions where a state transitions back to itself.
Incoming transition for q1 comes from q0 with label "1". Outgoing transition goes to q2 with label "1".  Incoming: q0 → q1 (label "1")  Outgoing: q1 → q2 (label "1")
From state q2, the transition is:  - **q2** has an outgoing transition labeled "1" to **q3**.  Additionally, incoming transitions to **q2** come from:  - **q1** with a label "1".
For state q2: - **Entry transitions**: From q1 with label "1". - **Exit transitions**: To q3 with label "1".
