# Grammar
Is q4 a sink state (no outgoing transitions)?
Does the automaton have any dead-end states?
What is the total number of labels used in transitions?

# Theory
Can the automaton be converted to a regular expression?
What is the maximum number of transitions from any state?
Can an automaton have multiple initial states?
How can the automaton be modified to accept more strings?
What happens if we remove a state from the automaton?
What modifications can be made to the automaton?
Can the automaton be extended with additional states?

# To sort
If we change the initial state, how does the automaton change?

# Automaton
Is the automaton minimal?
What is the minimum number of states required?
